**U.S. States Game**

A Python project where you guess the names of U.S. states and see them appear on a blank map!

This game helps you learn U.S. geography in a fun and interactive way using Turtle graphics and Pandas data handling.


**How to Play**

A blank U.S. map will appear.

Enter the name of a state into the prompt.

If correct, the state's name will show up on the map at its correct location.

Keep guessing to see how many states you can find!

Type Exit to end the game early.
